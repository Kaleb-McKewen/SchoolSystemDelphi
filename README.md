# SchoolSystemDelphi
School System written in Pascal using Delphi. DUnitX was used for testing, a test driven development methodology was used.

## Info
The school sysem allows for classrooms to be made that can include one assigned teacher and multiple students.
The repository is split into three pascal units. SchoolTest is for testing purposes of the school system using the DunitX framework, the unit was used in a DUnitX project with FastMM5 installed to detect memory leaks.
The School Unit allows for classrooms classes to be created and stored in a school object. Accounts can have a teacher and multiple students assigned, along with a role call and student count.
The Person Unit allows for teachers and students to be created with first name, last name and a to string function.
The files were developed within a project group.
Below is a UML diagram to convey the structure of the classes and their relationships using Object Orientated Programming.

## Reflection
I'm still very new to Pascal and coding using Delphi and leant about inheritance, overloading and overriding functions.
